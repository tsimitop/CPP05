void	Bureaucrat::signForm(AForm& form)


• ShrubberyCreationForm: Required grades: sign 145, exec 137
Create a file <target>_shrubbery in the working directory, and writes ASCII trees
inside it.
• RobotomyRequestForm: Required grades: sign 72, exec 45
Makes some drilling noises. Then, informs that <target> has been robotomized
successfully 50% of the time. Otherwise, informs that the robotomy failed.
• PresidentialPardonForm: Required grades: sign 25, exec 5
Informs that <target> has been pardoned by Zaphod Beeblebrox.

All of them take only one parameter in their constructor: the target of the form. For
example, "home" if you want to plant shrubbery at home.

Lastly, add the executeForm(AForm const & form) member function to the Bureaucrat.
It must attempt to execute the form. If it’s successful, print something like:
<bureaucrat> executed <form>
If not, print an explicit error message.
